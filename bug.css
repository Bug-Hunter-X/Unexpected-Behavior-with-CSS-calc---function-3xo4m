The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there are some unusual scenarios that can cause errors. For example, if you try to use `calc()` with units that can't be combined (like `px` and `em`), you might get unexpected results. Another potential issue arises when dealing with nested `calc()` functions. The order of operations might lead to unintended outcomes if not handled carefully.  Incorrect spacing or missing operators within the `calc()` expression can also lead to calculation errors.
